## Why this tool exists

Every Flutter developer building for iOS hits the same wall:

**You need a Mac with Xcode just to:**

- Drag `GoogleService-Info.plist` into the Runner folder
- Enable Push Notifications in Signing & Capabilities
- Enable Background Modes
- Add your Google Maps API key to AppDelegate

**This means:**

- Windows developers are completely blocked
- Developers with no Mac access are stuck

**This tool removes that wall entirely.**

Run one command from **any OS — Windows, macOS, Linux** — and all iOS capabilities are configured correctly:

- `project.pbxproj` updated with correct UUIDs
- `Runner.entitlements` created
- `AppDelegate.swift` configured
- `Info.plist` updated

After running the tool, push your code and build via any CI/CD.
**Your iOS app is ready — no Mac, no Xcode, no manual steps.**

---

## Features

- ✅ Firebase & Push Notifications — full setup in seconds
- ✅ Background Modes — select only the modes you need
- ✅ Google Maps — API key + AppDelegate setup
- ✅ Works on **Windows, macOS, and Linux** — no Xcode required
- ✅ Idempotent — safe to run multiple times, never duplicates
- ✅ Validates `GoogleService-Info.plist` before making any changes
- ✅ After setup, build and deploy via any CI/CD without touching Xcode

---

## Prerequisites

Before running the tool:

### 1. Add your `GoogleService-Info.plist`

Download it from Firebase Console → Your Project → iOS App → Download config file.

Place it at exactly this path:

```
your_project/
└── ios/
    └── Runner/
        └── GoogleService-Info.plist  ← here
```

### 2. Match your Bundle ID

The Bundle ID in `GoogleService-Info.plist` must match your Flutter project's Bundle ID.

Change your project's Bundle ID easily:

```bash
dart pub global activate change_app_package_name
dart run change_app_package_name:main com.yourcompany.yourapp
```

See: https://pub.dev/packages/change_app_package_name

### 3. Dart SDK >= 3.0.0

---

## Installation

```bash
dart pub global activate flutter_ios_configurator
```

---

## Usage

Run from the **root of your Flutter project:**

```bash
flutter_ios_configurator
```

> **Windows users:** If the command is not recognized, run:
>
> ```bash
> dart pub global run flutter_ios_configurator
> ```
>
> Or add `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Pub\Cache\bin` to your system PATH.

### Step 1 — Select capabilities

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  📋 Instructions:
     SPACE  = select / deselect
     ENTER  = confirm selection
     ↑ ↓    = navigate

? Select capabilities to configure
  ◯ Firebase & Push Notifications
  ◯ Background Modes
  ◯ Google Maps
```

### Step 2 — Follow the prompts

Select Background Modes if needed, enter your Google Maps API key if selected.

### Step 3 — Done

```
✅ Created Runner.entitlements
✅ Updated Info.plist — added UIBackgroundModes
✅ Updated AppDelegate.swift — added Firebase setup
✅ Updated project.pbxproj — registered GoogleService-Info.plist
✅ Updated project.pbxproj — iOS deployment target set to 15.0

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✅ iOS configuration complete!
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### Step 4 — Build via CI/CD

Push your code and build via your preferred CI/CD service.

**If you have Mac access** — run pod install first:

```bash
cd ios && pod install
```

**If you don't have Mac** — use Codemagic or GitHub Actions. They handle pod install automatically as part of the iOS build process.

**Codemagic** (recommended — GUI based, no YAML needed):

1. Connect your repo
2. Select Flutter version and Xcode version
3. Choose Debug / Release / Profile
4. Start build — pod install runs automatically

**GitHub Actions:**

```yaml
jobs:
  build-ios:
    runs-on: macos-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: subosito/flutter-action@v2
        with:
          flutter-version: "3.32.8"
      - run: flutter pub get
      - run: cd ios && pod install
      - run: flutter build ios --debug --no-codesign
```

| `AppDelegate.swift`   | Adds Firebase imports, `FirebaseApp.configure()`, FCM delegate                      |
| `project.pbxproj`     | Registers `GoogleService-Info.plist`, adds entitlements to all build configurations |
| `project.pbxproj`     | Sets `IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` to 15.0                                           |
